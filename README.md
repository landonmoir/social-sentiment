# Social Sentiment Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension that analyzes tweets on Twitter.com based on the AFINN sentiment analysis algorithm.
The original goal was to have this work on both twitter and reddit but I couldn't figure out reddit.

## Project Details

This project uses React/Typescript and vite as the build system

Main code lives in `content-script/src`
Setting pages lives in `src/App.tsx`

## Installation

1. Clone repository
2. To install dependencies `yarn install`
3. To build: `yarn build`

## TODO

- Get to work on reddit
- Live analyze while typing a tweet
- More settings
